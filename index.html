   <h2><u>FAQs on BMI</U></h2>
   <h3 style="font-size:120%;"><b>
    <ul>
    <li>What is BMI?<br>
    BMI is an acronym for Body Mass Index, and it is an indicator of the amount of fat which is stored in the human body. It provides a measure of the appropriateness of your weight to your height,
    based on health issues which are known to arise as a result of having a BMI which is too low or too high.</li><br><br>
    <li>Who invented BMI?<br>
    The BMI formula and its name were invented by different people, living in different centuries. The BMI formula was developed in the 1830s by Adolphe Quetelet, a Belgian mathematician and social statistician. He used his skills in calculus and statistics to analyse the relationship between height and weight in populations, and formulated what was known for 140 years as the Quetelet Index. In 1972 the American biologist and physiologist Ancel Keys published a paper endorsing the validity of the index, and in the process he renamed it and popularised it as the Body Mass Index.</li><br><br>
    <li>Why is BMI important?<br>
    BMI is important as it is able to predict, with considerable accuracy, mortality and morbidity rates in populations. What this means is that BMI is not only able to predict the rates at which people within a given population or group will die and suffer disease, but it is able to predict the incidence of the different types of diseases which occur in the population and which cause those deaths. However, as Adolphe Quetelet (see ‘Who invented BMI?’ above) and Ancel Keys stressed, BMI’s predictive abilities apply to populations only, and not to individuals within it.</li><br><br>
    <li>When should BMI be used?<br>
    The calculation of BMI can be used for males and non-pregnant females between the ages of 18 and 65. Although BMI is calculated for children in exactly the same way as for adults, the results are used in an entirely different way and for that reason a standard BMI calculator should not be used for those under the age of 18. Also, the physiology of elderly people differs from other adults (due to factors such as muscle wasting and height reduction), and consequently BMI calculations should not be made for that group. BMI calculations are also unsuitable for those who have developed significant amounts of muscle mass through physical exercise, as the results will tend to indicate higher levels of body fat than is actually the case.</li><br><br>
    <li>Is BMI officially recognised?<br>
    Yes, BMI is officially recognised by the World Health Organisation, and it is endorsed by a wide range of government agencies and medical organisations throughout the world. This official recognition has led to BMI being used extensively in both the public and private sectors in all developed countries.<br><br>
    <li> Muscle mass affect BMI?<br>
    Muscle mass in itself does not affect BMI, but very high and very low levels of muscle mass in relation to people of the same gender and ethnicity can produce misleading BMI results. For example, body builders can develop substantial muscle mass and have low levels of stored fat, leading to BMI results which may indicate that they are overweight when that is not the case. Also, elderly people can experience muscle wasting but maintain high levels of stored fat, leading to BMI results which incorrectly indicate that they are in the healthy weight range. For this reason people in either of these groups should not rely on BMI calculations.</li><br><br>
    <li>Is gender a factor in BMI?<br>
    Yes, gender is a factor in BMI, even though the World Health Organisation (for simplicity) uses the same BMI categories and ranges for both males and females. However, it is well documented that women tend to carry higher levels of stored fat than men. For women with a BMI in the healthy weight range, fat comprises around 15% to 20% of total body weight, whereas the corresponding percentages in men are 10% to 15%. The reason why women tend to carry more fat than men is the biological expectation of pregnancy, and the imperative to nourish the feotus.</li><br><br>
    <li>How accurate is BMI?<br>
    In itself, BMI is entirely accurate, but the question probably relates to how accurate BMI is in classifying people as having either a healthy weight or an unhealthy weight. When used for populations, BMI has been found to be very accurate in predicting the incidence of mortality and morbidity due to specific medical conditions, and this is the use for which it was originally designed. It is less accurate in relation to individuals for the reason that it does not directly measure body fat. While for many people BMI is a reliable indicator of healthy or unhealthy levels of body fat, for some it can give incorrect indications. These can include, for example, people who are either very tall or very short, or people who are heavily muscled.</li><br><br>
    <li>Are there any other measures I could use?<br>
    Yes, there are other measures you could use in addition to BMI, and these relate to waist metrics. While BMI can indicate healthy and unhealthy levels of body fat, it is not able to measure how fat is distributed in the body, and this is an important factor. For example, two people of the same gender and ethnicity, and who have an identical BMI, could have very different distributions of body fat. One could, for example, be centrally obese while the other is not. Excess amounts of abdominal (or visceral) fat can be much more harmful than other types of stored fat.</li>
